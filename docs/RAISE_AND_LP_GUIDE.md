## üåä METEORA LP POOL SETUP (CRITICAL)

### Why Meteora?
- Dynamic liquidity pools (DLMM)
- Capital efficient
- Lower impermanent loss
- Popular on Solana

### Step-by-Step LP Setup

#### Step 1: Calculate LP Allocation
**From Verified Tokenomics:**
- 30M tokens (30%) reserved for liquidity
- Match with USDC based on initial token price

**Math:**
```
Token Price: $0.15
LP Tokens: 30,000,000
Required USDC: 30M √ó $0.15 = $4,500,000 USDC
```

**PROBLEM:** You probably won't have $4.5M in USDC!

**SOLUTION:** Use partial LP based on raise amount

---

#### Step 2: Determine LP Size Based on Raise

**If you raise $100K:**
```
Raised: $100,000
Recommended LP: 20% of raise = $20,000 USDC
Tokens to pair: $20,000 √∑ $0.15 = 133,333 tokens

LP Composition:
- 133,333 tokens
- 20,000 USDC
- Creates $40K liquidity pool
```

**If you raise $300K:** (Recommended)
```
Raised: $300,000
Recommended LP: 25% of raise = $75,000 USDC
Tokens to pair: $75,000 √∑ $0.15 = 500,000 tokens

LP Composition:
- 500,000 tokens
- 75,000 USDC
- Creates $150K liquidity pool
```

**If you raise $1M:**
```
Raised: $1,000,000
Recommended LP: 30% of raise = $300,000 USDC
Tokens to pair: $300,000 √∑ $0.15 = 2,000,000 tokens

LP Composition:
- 2,000,000 tokens
- 300,000 USDC
- Creates $600K liquidity pool
```

---

#### Step 3: Meteora DLMM Configuration

**Recommended Settings:**
```javascript
{
  baseToken: "COFFEE", // Your token
  quoteToken: "USDC",
  binStep: 25, // 0.25% price steps (tight spread)
  initialPrice: 0.15, // $0.15 per token
  minPrice: 0.10, // 33% below
  maxPrice: 0.50, // 233% above

  // Liquidity distribution
  activeBin: "0.15", // Center at launch price
  binRange: 10, // ¬±10 bins for concentrated liquidity
}
```

**Why These Settings:**
- `binStep: 25` = Tight spread for better prices
- Range $0.10-$0.50 = Covers 5x price movement
- Concentrated around $0.15 = Most efficient capital use

---

#### Step 4: Execution Checklist

**Pre-Launch:**
- [ ] Tokens minted (100M total)
- [ ] Presale complete (X tokens sold)
- [ ] USDC ready for LP (Y amount)
- [ ] Meteora pool created
- [ ] Price feeds configured

**Launch Day:**
1. End presale at exact UTC time
2. Immediately create Meteora pool
3. Add initial liquidity (tokens + USDC)
4. Announce pool address
5. Monitor for first trades

**Post-Launch:**
- Monitor pool depth
- Add more liquidity from treasury if needed
- Track price vs initial $0.15
- Monthly buybacks from profits

## üîê TREASURY MANAGEMENT

### Where Does the Raised Money Go?

**30% ‚Üí Immediate LP**
Example: Raise $300K ‚Üí $75K USDC to LP

**10% ‚Üí Treasury Reserve (Tokens)**
10M tokens held for:
- Future liquidity additions
- Emergency funding
- Strategic partnerships

**60% ‚Üí Business Operations**
Example: Raise $300K ‚Üí $180K for build-out
- Location, equipment, inventory, staff, marketing

---

## üìà LIQUIDITY DEPTH TARGETS

**Minimum Viable:** $40K liquidity
- Can handle $1K-2K trades without major slippage
- Enough for early investors to exit if needed

**Healthy:** $150K liquidity (Recommended)
- Can handle $5K-10K trades smoothly
- Professional appearance
- Attracts larger buyers

**Robust:** $600K+ liquidity
- Can handle $20K+ trades
- Institutional-grade
- Listed on aggregators

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: PRICE STABILITY PLAN

**Problem:** If token price crashes below $0.15, investors lose money

**Solution: Price Floor Mechanism**
1. **Buybacks:** Use 10% of profits to buy below $0.15
2. **Treasury Support:** 10M token treasury can add LP if needed
3. **Vesting:** Team tokens vest over 24 months (no dump)
4. **Customer Rewards:** Distributed over 5 years (not all at once)

**Math:**
- Even if price drops to $0.10, buybacks kick in
- $5K monthly profit √ó 10% = $500/month to buy back
- Creates constant buy pressure = price floor

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED EXECUTION

**Phase 1: Presale (Now)**
- Target: Raise $300K
- Sell: 2M tokens (6.7% of presale)
- Timeline: 30-60 days

**Phase 2: LP Creation (Launch Day)**
- Add $75K USDC + 500K tokens to Meteora

- Marketing & staff: $40K

**Phase 4: Treasury Reserve ($45K)**
